I am a 5th year Ph.d candidate in Statistics and Computer Science. My interest lies in the theory and application of machine learning algorithms, especially in statistical inference under
Reinforcement Learning and Bandit settings, as well as Causal Inference in Machine Learning. Besides, I am passionate and familiar with many statistical models and have a strong foundation in coding and mathematics.
